📚📱 Smart Library App

Smart Library App is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter 🦋 and Firebase 🔥 to modernize public library systems. Traditional libraries rely on manual registers for tracking book availability and borrowing, which limits accessibility and efficiency.

This app provides a simple and user-friendly digital solution where users can 🔍 discover books, ✅ check real-time availability, 📌 reserve books, and 📊 track borrowing status directly from their mobile devices.

The project uses Flutter 🦋 for building responsive UI, Dart 💻 as the programming language, and Firebase 🔥 for authentication and real-time data management. It is developed as part of Kalvium – Simulated Work Sprint #2 🚀, focusing on modern mobile app architecture and seamless backend integration.
